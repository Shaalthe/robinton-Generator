# ANTLRBase
The base cmake setup for a C++ project that generates an ANTLR lexer and parser.

# Usage (Building)
### Linux
  1. Install git, java (only the runtime is necessary), and cmake (>= v3.0).
     - Until now, cmake has found the dependencies without issues. If you
       encounter an issue, let me know and we can fix it.
  1. Make a directory that you intend to build the project in and change into
     that directory.
  1. Run `cmake <path-to-ANTLR-Base>`.
  1. Run `make`.
  1. Done.

# Usage (For new assignments)
  1. Create a new _empty_ repository.
  1. Clone empty repository, it will warn you that the repository is empty.
  1. Create the master branch using `git checkout -b master`.
  1. Create `README.md` with some small content, you can edit this more once you
     merge ANTLRBase. Commit it.
  1. Add the ANTLRBase repository as an upstream remote using
    `git remote add upstream <clone-link>`.
  1. Fetch the contents of the upstream using `git fetch upstream`.
  1. Merge ANTLRBase into this repository using
     `git merge master upstream/master`.
  1. Edit grammar related cmake sections. (`GRAMMAR_NAME` and `ANTLR_NAMESPACE`
     in the base directory's `CMakeLists.txt`, rename and edit
     `grammar/placeholder.g4` accordingly).
  1. Distribute.

Once the upstream remote is added, pulling in new content from the upstream
only requires fetching then merging.
