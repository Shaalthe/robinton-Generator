# Usage (Building)
### Linux
  1. Install git, java (only the runtime is necessary), and cmake (>= v3.0).
     - Until now, cmake has found the dependencies without issues. If you
       encounter an issue, let me know and we can fix it.
  1. Make a directory that you intend to build the project in and change into
     that directory.
  1. Run `cmake <path-to-ANTLR-Base>`.
  1. Run `make`.
  1. Done.

# Usage (For new assignments)
  1. Edit grammar related cmake sections. (`GRAMMAR_NAME` and `ANTLR_NAMESPACE`
     in the base directory's `CMakeLists.txt`, rename and edit
     `grammar/placeholder.g4` accordingly).
  1. Distribute.
